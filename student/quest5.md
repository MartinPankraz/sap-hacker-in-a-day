# Quest 5 - Generate a remediation with GPT based on your custom rule (Experts | optional)

[< Quest 4 ](quest4.md) - **[üè†Home](../README.md)** - [ Quest 6 >](quest6.md)

In quest 3 you configured simple alert forwarding to a Microsoft Teams Channel using a playbook (aka Azure LogicApp). Enhance your playbook with a suggested remediation generated by a large language model.

* Explore the [LogicApps connector for Azure OpenAI](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-integration-services-blog/public-preview-of-azure-openai-and-ai-search-in-app-connectors/ba-p/4049584)
* Craft a prompt using the AI playground, chat interface, or whatever is available to you, to generate a meaningful remediation message based on your alert.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most of the AI service providers have discontinued their free tier and switched to pre-paid billing. You can still use the interactive user experience for free for limited use.

* Implement the prompt into your playbook and run the automation by triggering the alert. Learn more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/automation/automation).

> [!NOTE]
> This quest empowered you to design your own specialized remediation suggestions. See the [Copilot for Security documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-security-academy/microsoft-copilot-for-security#use-cases) for more info on out-of-the-box remediation suggestions.
