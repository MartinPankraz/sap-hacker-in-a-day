## We'll have some notes for you as you go

> [!TIP]
> A tip will provide with some insights to make your journey easier.

> [!NOTE]
> Provide some additional information or context to the current task.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An 'Important' box will will provide mandatory instructions to avoid pitfalls.

## Lab prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A machine (virtual or physical) with **local admin rights** is mandatory to download, install and run the required software!

> [!WARNING]
> Even with a guided workshop you need to be able to use RDP connections. Corporate firewalls may block RDP connections to unknown destinations. If you are unable to connect, please try a personal device instead.

> [!TIP]
> Optionally, configure your [Entra ID instance to enforce MFA](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa). This will help you to see how the phishing simulation tool can be used to bypass MFA.

### Fallback for unguided workshops

<details><summary>When <b>not</b> in a guided workshop ensure you have...</summary>
<b>Azure Subscription</b>: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).</br>
<b>Setup a phishing simulation tool</b> of your choice. Following screenshots and video references refer to Evilginx3.</br>
<b>A phishing target</b>: This could be a test account and sandbox system that has a web experience with your Identity Provider (IdP) configured for login. We will use a sample [SAP system and Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/saas-apps/sap-netweaver-tutorial) for this tutorial.</br>
