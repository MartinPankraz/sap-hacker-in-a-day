- **Azure Subscription**: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- **Setup a phishing simulation tool** of your choice. Following screenshots and video references refer to Evilginx3.
- **A phishing target**: This could be a test account and sandbox system that has a web experience with your Identity Provider (IdP) configured for login. We will use a sample [SAP system and Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/saas-apps/sap-netweaver-tutorial) for this tutorial.
- **A Sentinel for SAP instance**: Learn more about the free trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/offers/microsoft-sentinel-sap-promo/).
- **An SAP instance connected to Sentinel for SAP**: Learn more about how to onboard [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/sap/deployment-overview).

> [!TIP]
> Optionally, configure your [Entra ID instance to enforce MFA](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa). This will help you to see how the phishing simulation tool can be used to bypass MFA.
