# SAP Hacker in a day workshop👾

Welcome to your **red teaming hands-on lab** experience! This repos gets you all setup to embark on your assigned epic quest. Excited yet?

```

Today you will be switching sides🦹🏻‍♂️.

## Introduction

Anyone with a very basic understanding of SAP systems and security can participate in this workshop. The workshop is designed to be self-paced and can be completed in 4 hours. The workshop is divided into multiple quests, each quest will have a set of tasks that you need to complete. Each quest will have a set of tasks that you need to complete.

This workshop gives you a glimpse into the world of a [red team'er](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team). You will learn how to exploit a vulnerable SAP system login and how to detect & respond to ever evolving attacks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This work is merely a demonstration of what adept attackers can do. It is the defender's responsibility to take such attacks into consideration and find ways to protect their users against this type of attacks. The linked resources should be used only in legitimate penetration testing assignments or educational purposes. The authors are not responsible for any misuse of the tools mentioned.

* Familiarize yourself with the scenario using the provided [Powerpoint deck](misc/welcome.pptx).
