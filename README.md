# SAP Hacker in a day workshop👾

Welcome to your **red teaming hands-on lab** experience! This repos gets you all setup to embark on your assigned epic quest. Excited yet?

## Introduction

```text
Defenders often think in check lists to protect their SAP systems. Attackers think in graphs to exploit them. 
```

This workshop gives you a glimpse into the world of a [red team'er](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team). You will learn how to exploit a vulnerable SAP system login and how to detect & respond to ever evolving attacks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This work is merely a demonstration of what adept attackers can do. It is the defender's responsibility to take such attacks into consideration and find ways to protect their users against this type of attacks. The linked resources should be used only in legitimate penetration testing assignments or educational purposes. The authors are not responsible for any misuse of the tools mentioned.

* Familiarize yourself with the scenario using the provided [Powerpoint deck](misc/welcome.pptx).

> [!TIP]
